General-purpose coding language
Unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. It is a cross platform,object-oriented programming language, comparable to Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java.

Let'scheck installed python version.
python --version

If python is not installed, download it for free from the following website: https://www.python.org/

Interpreted programming language

Developer can write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

First Coding experience

create helloworld.py file and put following line in it.
print("Hello, World!")

Open a cmd inside the folder where the 'helloworld.py' is in and run following command.
python helloworld.py

Run python code within the cmd it self.

type python or py in the cmd
This convert the cmd to python command line.

Then print("Hello, World!") can be run with there it self, no need of a file.

Use 'exit()' to exit from python command line. 

Python Indentation

Indentation is used to indicate a block of code.

``Correct
if 5 > 2:
  print("Five is greater than two!")
  
Error
if 5 > 2:
print("Five is greater than two!")

The number of spaces is up to you as a programmer, but it has to be at least one.

Correct
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!") 
if 5 > 2:
        print("Five is greater than two!") 
      
Error
if 5 > 2:
 print("Five is greater than two!")
        print("Five is greater than two!")``
